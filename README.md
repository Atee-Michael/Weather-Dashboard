# Weather-Dashboard

## Overview
A weather app that allows users to search for current weather and 5 day forecast data for a city.

## Usage
Open index.html in a browser to use the app.
Enter a city name in the input field and submit the form to view the weather data.
The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data. When a city is submitted in the form, the getWeather function is triggered, which makes two API calls: one for the current weather and one for the 5 day forecast. The returned data is then displayed in the appropriate HTML elements using JavaScript.

The city search history is stored in the app and can be viewed by scrolling down the page.
